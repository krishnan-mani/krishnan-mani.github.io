There are more ways than one to help support a rider on an endurance challenge. I learnt these in fun, interesting, and challenging ways the three times I was part of the support CREW for cyclists at the [Deccan Cliffhanger][deccan-cliffhanger-cycle-race] starting 2015 (but that is a subject for future posts)

Regardless of how you contribute, I hope you spend a minute to think about how cancer may have affected you or someone you know, and how we might look forward to a future free of cancer.

Here are some ideas:

0. (of course!) Make a donation.
1. Raise funds in other ways.
2. Get my support crew, my bicycle, and me to the [Brands Hatch circuit][brands-hatch-UK-revolve24-2019] (and back).
3. Cheer me on at the ride, and support me with food, water, and motivation.
4. Get the word out, and raise awareness.
5. _"[your idea goes here!]"_

#### Make a donation

You can donate via the [website][justgiving-ride4ever], or in person. Buy a raffle ticket from me (for 3 pounds) to guess the number of laps I will complete on the challenge. Ask your friends, family, and colleagues at work to donate, and send it on. JustGiving supports [paying in any money we raise offline][justgiving-paying-in-offline]

#### Raise funds in other ways

Volunteer your time and effort. Maybe you can make some tasty treats to sell. Maybe you just did some spring cleaning, and can sell some unused stuff for charity. My wife has volunteered to cook some food for a sale. (I am waiting for apples in the backyard to ripen in a few weeks, so I can sell some) The possibilities are many.

#### Get us to the racing track

On the 14th of September, my support crew, my bicycle, and me must get to the startline at the Brands Hatch circuit by 3 pm, and back the next evening. You can drive us there (and back to Oxford)

#### Support us at the ride

It can be a great experience helping out at the ride. I will need nourishment, motivation, strategy, and someone reliable that is vigilant about my needs, as I keep coming round lap after lap, at some really odd hours during the challenge. All my experiences crewing for a ride taught me a great deal about myself, and it might be the same for you. In many ways, the support crew invest as much effort (or more) as the rider, to make a ride successful.

#### Get the word out!

Your social skills can help us get the word out and get more people interested in this cause. Let us know if we have all the links you need, and you can even volunteer to help us with social media.

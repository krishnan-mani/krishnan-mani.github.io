There are more ways than one to help support a rider on an endurance challenge. I learnt these in a fun, interesting, and challenging ways the three times that I was part of the CREW for cyclists at the [Deccan Cliffhanger][deccan-cliffhanger-cycle-race] starting 2015 (but that is a subject for future posts)

Regardless of how you might contribute, I hope you spend a minute to think about how cancer may have affected you or someone you know, and how we might look forward to a future free of cancer.

Here are some ideas:

0. (of course!) Make a donation.
1. Raise funds in other ways.
2. Get me, my bicycle, and the support crew to the [Brands Hatch circuit][brands-hatch-UK-revolve24-2019] (and back).
3. Cheer me on at the ride, and support me with food, water, and motivation.
4. Get the word out, and attract more people to help out
5. _"[your idea goes here!]"_

#### Make a donation

You can donate via the [website][justgiving-ride4ever], or in person. Buy a raffle ticket from me (for 3 pounds) to guess the number of laps I will complete on the challenge. 

#### Raise funds in other ways

Volunteer your time and effort. Maybe you can make some tasty treats to sell, and donate the proceeds. The possibilities are many.

#### Get us to the racing track

My support crew, me, and my bicycle must get to the Brands Hatch circuit on the 14th of September at the start line at 3 pm, and back the next evening. You can drive us there (and back?)

#### Support us at the ride

Its a great experience helping out at the ride. I will need nourishment, motivation, strategy, and someone reliable that is vigilant about my needs, as I keep coming round lap after lap, at some really odd hours during the challenge. All my experiences crewing for a ride taught me a great deal about myself.

#### Get the word out!

Your social skills can help us get the word out and get more people interested in this cause. Let us know if we have all the links you need, and you can even volunteer to help us with social media.

### Summary 
Hands-on technical leader practising agile software development and continuous delivery. I pro-actively bring about change, and an inclusive culture of continuous improvement within teams.

Having worked across the board in a number of roles within organisations both big and small, I see systems as a unified whole, to be delivered collaboratively. 

Beginning in 1999, I designed, developed, integrated, delivered, and operated large end-to-end solutions including bespoke software development, and networks, servers, and internet services from the ground up (long before "Cloud"  and "DevOps" became buzzwords). As recently as 2018, I was helping diverse customers make the most of the cloud, as a Solutions Architect with Amazon Web Services. 

### Skills, Domains, and Roles

- Creating apps and platforms with container-based microservices on the JVM with Spring on Kubernetes, CI+CD with Jenkins
- Expert knowledge of cloud, with AWS (5x certified)
